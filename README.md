# Lift-me-up
Lift Me Up 🙌
Project Description
This website will give the user a randomly generated positive message; it could be a quote or just something to make their day better. After 10 presses of the button, a small survey will ask them questions on how the user's day is going. 🌞
Technology Areas Involved

HTML 💻
JavaScript 🐱‍💻
CSS 🎨

Main Problem or Challenge to Address
The main problem is that not everyone can just feel better, but the website's main goal is to just give them that thought. The thought that someone cares. 💝
Target Audience or Users
Anyone who is not feeling the best, doesn't matter why they're down. 😟
Key Features or Functionalities
There will be a button on screen, with comforting music in the background to let the user know this is a safe and relaxing space. Upon clicking the button, text will generate and show a positive message. The user can click again for a different message. 🎶
